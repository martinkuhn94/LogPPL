     <h1>Welcome to LogPPL</h1>

<p>Welcome to <strong>LogPPL</strong>, a cutting-edge tool designed to revolutionize the way you approach process mining and simulation. LogPPL seamlessly integrates the power of Data Petri Nets (DPNs) with probabilistic programming, enabling you to generate event logs with robust statistical guarantees. Whether you are a researcher looking to explore complex process behaviors or a practitioner aiming to enhance your process analysis, LogPPL offers an intuitive and powerful platform to achieve your goals.</p>

<p>With LogPPL, you can easily transform DPN models into probabilistic programs, configure simulations with precision, and analyze results with confidence. Our tool supports a variety of advanced features, including customizable queries, flexible scheduling options, and the ability to export event logs in the industry-standard XES format. By bridging the gap between DPNs and probabilistic programming, LogPPL empowers you to conduct sophisticated simulations and gain deeper insights into the dynamics of your processes.</p>

<p>Explore the possibilities with LogPPL and take your process mining tasks to the next level with statistical rigor and advanced modeling capabilities.</p>

    <h2>Core Features</h2>

    <p>LogPPL is packed with features that make complex simulation tasks more accessible and efficient:</p>
